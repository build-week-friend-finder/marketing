# Friend Finder Landing Page

Important: this is the first web design I ever did in Lambda School (without direct guidance). Six months later, I could do a better job. And perhaps will rework the code later. But until then, I felt the need for a disclaimer.

Friend Finder was meant to be a platonic version of Tinder. Instead of looking for a romantic partner, you seek a new friend. Thus, the copy was written with pain points such as "I hate going to movies, concerts, restaurants, etc. by myself" in mind.

While the layout definitely needs work, this project marked a big turning point for me. I discovered the power of CSS animations, as demonstrated by how the photos slowly load and the color change transition effect applied to both buttons and nav links.

## How the Website Works

- Hover over the navigation menu options and buttons to see a transition effect.
- Decrease the screen size and observe how the layout transforms (thanks to flex box).
- For a similar take on the same concepts, click "About" for a slightly different look-and-feel.
