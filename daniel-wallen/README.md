# Friend Finder Landing Page

Important: this is the first web design I ever did in Lambda School (without direct guidance). A year later, I could do a much better job. 

Friend Finder was meant to be a platonic version of Tinder. Instead of looking for a romantic partner, you seek a new friend. Thus, the copy was written with pain points such as "I hate going to movies, concerts, restaurants, etc. by myself" in mind.

## How the Website Works

- Hover over the navigation menu options and buttons to see a transition effect.
- Decrease the screen size and observe how the layout transforms (thanks to flex box).
- For a similar take on the same concepts, click "About" for a slightly different look-and-feel.
